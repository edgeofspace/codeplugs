# EOSS Codeplugs

Various sample DMR code plugs for use with EOSS activities



This is the Edge Of Space Sciences repository for sample DMR radio codeplugs.

EOSS provides these sample codeplugs (DMR radio programs) as a service to its members who are encouraged to use them as a template to create/tailor a codeplug personalized for their own use. They are not intended to be all inclusive. These codeplugs are maintained by volunteers. Consider supporting DMR and EOSS by creating a codeplug for your radio and supplying updates as they are needed to us.

Many of these codeplugs are modified version of the Rocky Mountain Ham [RMHam](https://www.rmham.org/) sample codeplugs.
